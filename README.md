# Clean Up
This is heavily modified version of the shirsig addon. That addon works great but it would often get my items "locked"(greyed out) and I would have to relog to fix(if I didn't get disconnected).  

Basically, I put limits and timeouts on vendoring items and sorting bags. I also created a default button position for pfui bags and bagnon.
